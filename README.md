# Tic-Tac-Toe with Kotlin

The purpose of this project was for me to be able to learn the basics of Kotlin. I re-wrote this simple tic-tac-toe program that was originally written in Python.

Some of the things that I learned while writing this program were differnces in how you store information in Kotlin compared to Python. In my original Python version of this program I used a dictionary to store all the values but in Kotlin there are no dictionaries. Instead I had to use a map to store the moves made on the board by the players.

# Development Environment

While working on this project I used the following:
* VS Code
* Kotlin
* The "java.util.Scanner" library

# Useful Websites

These are the two main websites that I used to learn Kotlin and to troubleshoot my code. 

* [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming)
* [Kotlin Web Site](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)

# Future Work

These are some things that I could probably fix in the future if I had more time to work on the code or if I wanted to expand on the program.

* I would make it an option to restart the game witout re-running the program
* I would go back and make it more efficient when it checks for the winner
