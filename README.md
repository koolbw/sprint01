# Tic-Tac-Toe with Kotlin

The purpose of this project was for me to be able to learn the basics of Kotlin. I re-wrote this simple tic-tac-toe program that was originally written in Python.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

While working on this project I used the following:
* VS Code
* Kotlin
* The "java.util.Scanner" library

# Useful Websites

These are the two main websites that I used to learn Kotlin and to troubleshoot my code. 

* [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming)
* [Kotlin Web Site](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)

# Future Work

These are some things that I could probably fix in the future if I had more time to work on the code or if I wanted to expand on the program.

* I would make it an option to restart the game witout re-running the program
* I would go back and make it more efficient when it checks for the winner
